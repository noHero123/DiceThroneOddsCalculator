## dice throne odds calculator
thanks to Assassinater for his python gui
to build from source you need boost, eigen and sqlite3
contains lots of unrecommended/old code, just to show 4 different ways to calculate the odds:
- simulations of ORP (Offensive Roll Phase)
- MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)
- brute force
- markov chains (inspired from https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4032313/probability-of-yahtzee-straight-with-strict-re-roll-rules) (currently preffered way)
